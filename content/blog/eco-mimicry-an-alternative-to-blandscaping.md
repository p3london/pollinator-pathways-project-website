For example, when we neglect to plant native flowers, we also exclude the native pollinators that have evolved in tandem with the plants. The antidote to blandscaping is eco-mimicry where we allow nature to be our guide in designing not only aesthetically pleasing landscapes but those that offer a myriad of ecological relationships. Read more about blandscaping and why not all green space is created equal in this fascinating article byStuart Connop and Caroline Nash published by FastCompany!
